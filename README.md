# Analog Elcetronics-II-circuits
This repository is a college project consisting of Analog Electrinics Circuits (mainly OpAmp and its Applications) on the software cadence Pspice 9.1 Student Version.

# View Code
The code of the circuits can be viewed in a normal text editor.

# View Waveforms
To view the waveforms you will have to buy the latest OrCad pspice software from the Orcad website or the free student version from here --> http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~troppel/91pspstu.exe
1. Then Install from the setup.
2. Open pspice A/D
3. Open the probe files in pspice A/D then you will be able to see the output waveforms

# For Further projects in pspice
If you want to make further projects you can install the library files from the link below.
